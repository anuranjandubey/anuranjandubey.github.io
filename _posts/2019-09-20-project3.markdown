- Creation of Unique Dataset by bangle factory product and using Data augmentation.

- Applying ML Algorithms to Predict whether the bangle is Good, defected or partially defected.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Automation in the bangle industry is the base study of this work. The manufacturing of bangles is a complicated task and requires great concentration in visualizing the quality of bangles.</p>

<p>In bangle manufacturing industry, product defect directly contributes to the low quality of the products which lead to the failure of the industry. Although a human can easily identify the defects present, but its still a difficult task to examine each and every bangle. It is time-consuming as well as a tiresome process.</p>

<h3>Scope of the Project</h3>
<p>This device helps us to classify the bangles on the basics of defects (Physical level defects) during manufacturing and to distinguish between defected bangle and non-defected bangle thereby increasing the quality of production.</p>
<p>The device will also help to reduce the problem of finding the skilled workers who can identify the defect and also reduce the manufacturing cost of the bangles. It is a small step towards the automation of the bangle industry.</p>
